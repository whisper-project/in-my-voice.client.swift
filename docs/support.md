# Support 

If you have a question about using In My Voice, please start by reading the [Instructions](instructions.md) page, and then read through the following FAQ. If that does not answer your question(s), or if you just want to provide us with general feedback, there is a support form at the bottom of this page.

## FAQ

### Do I need an iPhone or iPad to use In My Voice?

Yes, at the present time the app is only available on Apple devices.

### Does In My Voice store the text that I have typed?

While you are within a Speech session, text that you have typed is remembered and displayed in the Past Text view. But all of this text is forgotten when you exit the session. It is not stored anywhere.

### Can I copy and paste text from my conversations?

Yes, you can copy and paste what you have typed in the app.

## Need More Support?

If the answers above have not solved your problem, please contact us through [this form](https://forms.gle/4VjS7AG1qrdpNHrZ6) and we will get back to you as soon as we can. Please note that this is a single-developer app, so response times will not be immediate (or maybe not even quick).

At the [Whisper Project](http://whisper-project.org), we are firm believers that there are NO stupid questions, especially when it comes to using technology. We want to make our apps as helpful as possible to everyone, so we truly appreciate your feedback.
