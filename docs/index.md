# In My Voice

In My Voice is an app that allows someone who doesn’t speak aloud to participate in a spoken conversation with others who do. The non-speaking participant participates by typing: their typed words are then vocalized using Text-to-Speech technology available from a number of different providers. The currently-supported providers are [Apple](https://support.apple.com/en-us/105018) and [Eleven Labs](https://elevenlabs.io), both of whom support “voice cloning”—the creation of a text-to-speech voice that sounds like a specific person.

To learn how to use the app, visit [Instructions](instructions.md). For help, visit [Support](support.md).

## Privacy

Neither the [Whisper Project](http://whisper-project.org) (the maker of In My Voice) nor [Software in the Public Interest](https://spi-inc.org) (the publisher of In My Voice) collects, stores, or processes any personal data, including face data, about individuals who use In My Voice.

The In My Voice app never collects usage data unless an individual user has chosen to participate in a research study. In that case, data about study participant usage is provided to the study administrators for research purposes. Details of what data is collected and how it is used varies from study to study; each study provides detailed information about this in their study agreements.

Because the In My Voice app automatically syncs app settings (including ElevenLabs voice settings and Favorites) among the devices registered to a specific Apple ID, a copy of these settings is kept on the In My Voice server. This data is accessible from devices registered to the user’s Apple ID and, after the user has explicitly requested it, by Whisper Project personnel for support purposes.

The In My Voice app collects and sends to its server a variety of diagnostic data.  This diagnostic data is not associated with any data about you as an individual or any data that can be used to identify you as an individual. This data is never used for any purpose except to resolve issues reported by users and to improve the app's behavior:

* Information about crashes and other errors that interrupt the use of the app.
* Identifiers created by the app that are specific to the device or the user’s app settings. These identifiers are random strings of characters that are different for each device and user.
* The dates and times that the app was launched, became active, became inactive, or was terminated.

All identifiers created by the app, as well as all associated settings and diagnostic data, are purged from the In My Voice server if the devices and settings they are associated with have not been used in the past 12 months.
