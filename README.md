# In My Voice: “talking” via voice clones

The advent of high-quality, AI-driven voice cloning and text-to-speech technologies has opened up a lot of possibilities for people who have lost the ability to produce their original voice. Now that high-quality voice clones can be created from as little as 20 or 30 seconds of speech, even users who did not intentionally create a “voice bank” before losing their voice can use “incidental recordings” (e.g., outgoing and incoming voicemail messages) to produce a high-quality voice clone with a number of different providers.

The *In My Voice* app allows users to type in what they want to say and, within a second or two, hear it produced by their custom voice clone. In addition, it allows users to create favorites that can be “typed” with a single button press. It also allows users to quickly repeat previous statements, or to copy them and edit them as needed.

The *In My Voice* app works with multiple voice clone providers, including Apple’s on-device speech facilities and online providers such as [ElevenLabs](https://elevenlabs.io). It’s also been designed for easy addition of new providers, and as an open-source app anyone in the community can contribute.

For users with multiple devices, *In My Voice* allows synchronizing voice and favorites settings across devices so the user experience is completely consistent.
